    "description": "The Temple of the Deep is a sanctuary for grief, love, and introspection, formed beneath a massive black stone that appears to hover above participants. This dark, fractured element symbolizes the weight of loss and the strength found in healing, inspired by kintsugi, where brokenness is embraced and honored. Seven narrow entrances guide visitors through the journey of mourning, leading to a central gathering space mirroring BRC's layout. Alcoves and chapels offer solitude and remembrance, while the seamless integration with the desert transforms sorrow into connection, grounding participants in shared reflection.",
