She has had a life-long love affair with music and dance - they are her spiritual practice and her most potent passions. ALIA transmits the bliss she experiences in performances to create a connected, alive and activated experience that evokes the sacred and awakens our connection to our source through rhythm and movement. She approaches every set as a ritual and as a facilitator of dance floor unity. ALIA has shared the stage with the likes of Beats Antique, Random Rab, Govinda, Freq Nasty, Marty Party, An-ten-nae, Heyoka, Pussymonster, Sasha Rose, Vibesquad, DJ Jocelyn, and Bay Area favorite DJ Dragonfly.

If you're interested in learning more about how to please your man orally, this is the place for you.\r\n\r\nCome on ladies / givers, you know you've got some skills - and some questions!  Come share your favorite tips and techniques by words and demonstration, and ask questions that have been plaguing you.\r\n\r\n\t* Drool or dry? \r\n\t* What about the gag reflex?\r\n\t* How do you use hands and still go deep?\r\n\r\nAnd guys, you must have comments you'd like to pass on, other than simply \"Yes, please\"!\r\n\r\n\t* Hate teeth?  Want teeth?\r\n\t* What about deep throat?\r\n\r\nHere's your chance to make your requests - and pet peeves - heard!\r\n\r\nThis is a participatory event open to couples of any combination, so long as one of them has some phallic protuberance and the other is applying lips, tongue, and maybe even throat to it.  No lookie-loos!\r\nThis was a great fun event at the last Burn.  The presenter's been researching all year to find new tidbits and info to share.  (Hey, someone's gotta do the tough jobs.)  Come show off, learn stuff, and have fun.",

The Burning Man event, like no other environment in the world, has created a unique venue for art, and has rekindled one of art\u2019s most valuable functions: connecting community members in creation, curiosity, and wonderment. At Burning Man, we observe how art brings people together, inspires participation and engenders meaningful connections between individuals. The art experienced at Burning Man invites individuals to interact with both the work itself and with their community at large.\r\n\r\nBRAF was established to bring this modality of creating and coexisting with art to the rest of the world, with the vision that community-driven, inclusive, and interactive art is vital to a thriving culture. The foundation received its 501(c)3 status in November of 2001. Come learn more and see how  you can get involved.",

This Body Acceptance Dance Party is a chance for all of us to let loose without feeling like we're being compared to the impossible commercial standards we face in the default world. Start the week off feeling fabulous about yourself with a playlist that includes Queen Latifah, Li'l Kim, Salt-N-Pepa, DJ Kool, Notorious BIG, A Tribe Called Quest and much more! Come and shake what your mama gave you and don't feel bad about it for one second. These are your people, you big beautiful burner!\r\nThere will be an art video/photo project being created, for posting on the internet after the event, which shows all of the variety of bodies we radically accept on the playa, not just the models that can make the director's cut for the \"Places you'll go\" video. Come and get your body painted as our artist sees fit and take a step to show off your radical self love!\r\nThere will be Sonoma County Sangria served at the Thirsty Camel bar and a multi-media dance extravaganza inside the dome. Special long distance appearance by performance poet and founder of TBINAA, Sonya Renee, via recorded audio and video.",

With guest DJs Lobsterdust, Entyme, Faroff, John!John!, Airsun, and more \u2013 along with mashup shows and performances throughout the night by  Alejandro and Adrian \u2013 Bootie BRC celebrates (and satirizes) pop culture both past and present, keeping your brain guessing and body dancing with creative song combinations. Mixing and matching every musical genre, era, and style into one big dance party, it's the soundtrack for the A.D.D. generation -- with free mashup CDs given away like candy! Launched in 2003 in San Francisco, Bootie was the first club night dedicated solely to the burgeoning artform of the bootleg mashup, and is now the biggest mashup event in the world, with regular parties in several cities on four continents. Bootie BRC is presented in part by the BRC Weekly, Black Rock City's independent newsweekly. Bootie ... because one song at a time just isn't enough.",

We welcome people of all backgrounds to this workshop and to this exploration of how the oppression we were taught in every day society plays out on playa.

At Circus Boot Camp, we'll teach you to juggle, unicycle, hoop, slack line, trapeze, crack a whip and indulge your childish fancy in other circus-inspired arts.\r\n\r\nI know what you're thinking: \"Sure, you'll teach me to juggle... after I've spent years on the road washing elephants and dodging monkey poop!\" Wrong! Our goal is nothing less than to bring the joys of object manipulation, unicycling and other circus arts to the Playa masses in a casual, friendly and fully clothed environment (ok, mostly-clothed).\r\n\r\nAlready a circus pro? Come test your mettle on our slackline; dance your clown shoes through the obstacles of irony; pass clubs with seasoned semi-professionals; try your hand at the Valley of One-Wheeled Doom!!",

Half the moves are with your partner, half with everyone else - so it has a tribal vibe, where the Zen is flow, synchrony, and bonding (not footwork, not competition). The repeated cycles of movement give dancers a long time to catch on.  In any case if you are smiling you are doing it right.  Dancers adjust their behavior to each new dancer they come to and gently realign fellow dancers if needed making contradancing one of the most accessible group dance forms, with for example mentally disabled, blind, deaf and wheelchair bound dancers at many dances.  Friendly to children and adults carrying children.  Sunset - midnightish (later if everyone keeps going), except Sat starts 30 min after the man falls, Sun starts 60 min after the temple burn begins.  Go to website to 'taste' dancing (including headcam video) and music.",

PCC Professor Richard Tarnas will give an enlightening talk on the historical role of \u201cheroic communities\u201d in transforming the world (like CIIS and Burning Man). Wear your best Playa fashions, bring your friends and family, and maybe even get some ideas for your next academic paper. Let\u2019s elevate \u201cschool spirit\u201d to a new dimension while we enjoy each other outside of our default roles. We\u2019ll have some drinks, we\u2019ll have some laughs, and we\u2019ll dance with reckless abandon as we get ready to transform the (default) world.\r\n\r\nCOSMOCPOIA [address]\r\nTuesday, August 27, 8PM",

It is an adventurous way of life--physically, emotionally and mentally that citizens of BRC embrace. Our shows are an opportunity for Dark Sparklers and other BRC citizens to explore and showcase their Dark Sparkle through performance, storytelling, and tease.

( please fill in location as we have not been assigned a space yet)\r\n\r\nWe finally found a solid use for white bread; it\u2019s the perfect building block. If you\u2019ve ever wondered about the compressive strength of a 10 day old loaf, make a point to come by and marvel at this free-standing enclosed structure. The material for this abode can be grown in one growing season and has an insulation value of R-5. The inspiration for this 10 foot diameter Dome of Dough is the traditional beehive shape of the charcoal kilns in Death Valley.\r\n\r\nCrawl inside, wonder at the meditative vibe and who knows, maybe there will be fresh bread and jam for snacking.\r\n\r\nWARNING: HI Gluten Zone!\r\n\r\nSubmitted by Howie Hawkes, AKA Hawkster, howie@hawkesconstruction.com",

You'll discover that you have all the resources you need to keep your body healthy and your mind at peace, using these simple, yet profound movements.  Jump, tap, shake, sway, and breath yourself into a state of tranquility & health.  There will be an emphasis on practical application; this is a workshop and ritual, not a lecture! All are welcome, especially beginners.  Open yourself to the magic coursing within. Qigong is much gentler than most forms of yoga, and a wonderful complement to a vigorous yoga practice.

With the\r\neyes closed and lying on a mat, each person uses their own breath and\r\nthe music in the room to enter a non-ordinary state of consciousness.\r\nThis state activates the natural inner healing process of the\r\nindividual's psyche, bringing him or her a particular set of internal experiences. With the inner healing intelligence guiding the process,\r\nthe quality and content brought forth is unique to each person and for\r\nthat particular time and place.

A national organization having its roots in family farms and community halls. \r\n\r\nMany Granges have become home to food literacy and sovereignty activists and the slow foods movement.\r\n\r\nWhile the Grange has its roots in a fraternal organization from the start it supported woman having an equal voice and vote.\r\n\r\nThe California State Grange is a leader in the Grange revitalization and was an early advocate of GMO labeling. \r\n\r\nCalifornia Prop 37 was initiated by a Granger.  California is one of many Granges throughout the country that are supporting a return of agriculture to local farming, organics, sustainable practices, alternative energy and localization of living and working.  We actively support the arts, music, education, youth and engage in a variety of community service projects.\r\n\r\nCalifornia Grange is on the forefront of revitalizing this organization that was founded after the Civil War by family farmers who opposed domination by big banks and railroads that controlled markets and prices. \r\n\r\nCorporatocracy is ever more powerful and many Granges actively oppose it.\r\n\r\nCome learn about the Grange and how we work to create relevant communities whether urban or rural rooted in family and friendship.",

We will together invoke the Divine Feminine in Her profoundly deep, naked, authentic, healing, initiatic role in order to give birth to our cosmic, true nature.  We have been fascinated and passionately exploring the Art of the Sacred Union for years, studying the tantric teachings of Kashmir Saivism tradition, Kaula lineage, Dasha Mahavidya system, Sufi mysticism, sexual shamanism, and occidental esoteric alchemy and psychology.

These agents provided the transcendent space that allowed inner wounds to be reconfigured into a more manageable and workable form, releasing the soul from inner/outer conflict.\r\n\r\nExperiences with three different entheogenic agents enabled me to access states of consciousness that fostered healing in my familial relationships by re-framing conflicts, through form of visions and wider understandings, in pictorial, mythological, and transcendent narratives. These experiences in the Other Worlds have been translated into substantial and concrete shifts in the Ordinary World.\r\n\r\nThis journey through the \u2018immaterial' considers entheogenic agents as psychological/emotional catalysts for transformation and growth. The Jungian framework of alchemy and individuation has been central in filtering my transformational process and the focus is on its relevance to integrating psychedelic explorations.",

Using brainwave-oracles to channel mental energy, the supplicants invoke the Tesla-Jinn and energize the cargo ritual, producing a fiery prayer-ring-of-hands, circling overhead faster and faster, and as the coil begins to energize a hoary crown of high voltage discharge develops a dome of plasma, arcing and sparking wildly, as the electromagnetic prayer is transmitted out into the heavens, and as the transubstantiation is at zenith the distant sound of approaching Voices can be heard, building in volume as a host of heavily-laden, ground-shaking, cargo-bearing bird machines bears down on the encampment, growing louder and louder until the thunderous, throbbing drone of a chorus of engines shakes the tower and brings an eruption of devotional energy as precious cosmic cargo rains down upon the blessed worshipers of dust and fire. Weather permitting.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to strap on a brainwave \"oracle\" and watch the monitor as you control your brainwaves and fire the flame cannons, invoking the \"Cosic Cargo Routine\".\r\n\r\nBrain cleansing services may be available throughout the day but we cannot commit to being properly staffed except on the posted time and date. We expect to be operational each night around dusk at the Hookah Lounge, providing at least one of the operating crew still survives and is able to awake the Jinn.",

YOU! \r\nAnd we're here to fix that. Like a chiropractor who adjusts your body, we adjust your life emotionally, mentally and spiritually, helping you see what's holding you back and giving you the tools to create the life you want.\r\n\r\nCamp IMAGINEnation is a life coaching camp dedicated to the power of dreaming and radical honesty. Our Life Coaches are trained in The Handel Method and go through an extensive 2-year or more training process on life issues and human behavior. \r\n\r\nCamp IMAGINEnation was founded by The Handel Group and born of an authentic and ambitious desire to change the world in a very positive way. It is a spiritual endeavor for us. We think that those who are willing to dig deep and look at themselves honestly are the most courageous people in the world, not to mention, people we\u2019d want to hang with. In a word, we are looking to make personal development cool. We think it is. \r\n\r\nThe Handel Method was developed over the last 15 years by HG Co-founder and Chairman, Lauren Zander. The method is the foundation for not only our life coaching work, but also for the courses we teach at MIT, NYU, Rutgers and Stanford Business Schools, and for the work we do within large companies in the Executive Coaching Division. The method is revolutionary yet easy to understand, methodical yet infinitely customizable. Most importantly of all, it has proven to be highly effective.\r\n\r\nTogether we dig deep, play big and don\u2019t stop until goals are fulfilled and lessons learned. We care, we love what we do and we walk our talk.",

(Sounds like \"gifting,\" eh?) He was freed, settled in Southern California, and started teaching classes of students and future teachers. Today, there are dozens of classes weekly around So Cal. Also, LSA is spreading around the US and world.  \r\nMany more details are available at:  HYPERLINK \r\n\"http://www.longevitystick.org/Longevitystick.org/Home.html \" www.longevitystick.org/Longevitystick.org/Home.html and  HYPERLINK \"http://www.filmbaby.com/films/2341 \"  \r\nMaster Dao passed away late 2010 at age 89, and I was privileged to attend his funeral, and his last birthday party, a few months before.",

Gravity central.Grounding is a vital component of daily balanced living. It allows us to deepen our connection with mother earth, or Gaia, and source energy. It teaches us how to release stress, stay focused, clear the chatter from our minds and auric fields, and eliminate free radicals from our bodies. When we connect with Gaia, we begin to realize that we are all safe and well provided for. We learn to understand our greater truths and to let go of fear, anger, guilt and anxiety. This allows us to establish a connection with our divine authentic self.\r\n\r\nWhether you are a seasoned meditator or novice, you are invited to experience an ancient Eastern meditation breathing technique that has been passed on from master to master for centuries to achieve self-enlightenment. In this workshop you will learn about the chakra system, with an emphasis on the root, sacral and solar plexus. Our chakras govern our life force energy as well as our glandular, mental and emotional systems. Through the use of sage, crystals and sound we will also start to understand basic cleansing of our auric field and our surroundings. We will utulize ancient grounding techniques and a guided meditation to establish our connection with Gaia, help transform our outlook, and feel more grounded in our everyday lives.",

It is the celebration of the masculine/feminine essence we enjoy so much!\r\n- Hair or Make Up will be available prior to the show for participants who show up early enough\r\n- A sense of rhythm helps but simply moving works just fine\r\n\r\nCome early and stay late for the Men's Lingerie Review in the Dungeon. Same models, sans outerwear. Models, bring your lace thongs, your hosiery, corsets and the pieces that make you feel sexy all under!\r\n\r\nDuring the shows, Retrofolic will offer delicious alcohol and non-alcohol beverages. Lights of color, art of goth and kink will treat your eyes. Music of tribal and trance, multiple scenes with howls of delight, moans of agony and screams of extremes will fill your ears in the 1600 feet squared dungeon space next door!",

According to wikipedia, Pure miso paste nutritional information: Although high in sodium (over 400% DV), one cup (275 g) of miso paste is an excellent source of dietary fiber (59%) and protein (64% DV), as well as a good source of minerals . Miso paste is also high in amino acids, the basic building blocks of protein. An excellent source of vitamin K and a decent source of riboflavin (38% DV), miso also provides small amounts of other vitamins. One major benefit of miso is its extremely high omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid content. We believe Miso saves Burners life on the Playa and leave them with good health all day.",

She will share some useful tools that can maximize our experience, as well as what we can learn, in those inner voyages. Non- ordinary states of consciousness can come with their own sets of 'superpowers', operating principles and potential pitfalls. Knowing how to use those forces for expansion, and alignment, can not only occasionally save you from 'the inner gates of hell', but also bring accelerated growth, ecstatic experiences, and a deep feeling of connectedness with yourself, others, and the world. Through lecture, sharing, and experiential exercises she will enrich your psychonaut- toolkit, and activate and empower your inner shaman.",

Open relationships, and/or polyamory, are becoming more widely known to the general public as an alternative to the default cultural model of monogamous relationships. One of the first questions that comes up for someone when they first hear about open relationship is \"Why?\" Why would anyone choose this model of relationship? Certainly at the beginning of someone's exploration of open relationship (and often for sometime to come), it would seem a guaranteed way to bring up ones deepest fears and insecurities. So why do it? \r\n\r\nWe will talk about open relationships and explore answers to these questions, from an unlikely frame, that of spiritual awakening. In my opinion, not only is open relationship compatible with a deep path of spiritual awakening, it may be one of the most profound ways to catalyze and walk that path.",

Take a walk through your house (or Burning Man camp) from plastic-packaged food in the kitchen to toothbrushes and shampoo in the bathroom, our world is full of plastic.  And at Burning Man, we are sleep in plastic sleeping bags in plastic tents and wear plastic goggles.  And how much of our food and water is packaged in plastic? Although some plastics make our lives better, much of it is a problem -- polluting our oceans and beaches and harming our health with toxic chemicals. But what can one person do to be part of the solution? Join us for inspiring stories and practical tips to reduce plastic in your home and on the Playa.  Author Beth Terry will share her journey from self-confessed plastic addict to empowered plastic-free activist and explain why we can't just recycle our way out of this mess.

However, unlike Wall Street we ask that you don\u2019t air your dirty laundry here, please bring clean socks (a little dusty is fine, just not stinky). You may bring singles or pairs and trade up or down with fellow traders. There will be a limited supply of IPO seed sock available for you to choose from if you find you are shorted of socks on arrival.  Trade once, trade twice, trade as many times as you want.  Trading ends when the final bell rings. Everyone comes out ahead, or afoot as the case may be.",

No lookie-loos!\r\nThis was a fun event at the 2011 Burn.  The presenter's been researching since then to find new tidbits and info to share.  (Hey, someone's gotta do the tough jobs.)

There are infinite possibilities from which we may choose along the way. It\u2019s the journey.We will learn from our experiences as we evolve as humans, and we may hopefully learn to peel away the layers of illusion fostered by maturity and our life experiences. Through study and inquiry we may also find common threads from the ancient teachings linked to modern expressions of spirituality.We may even sense unity at some point.What is beautiful about life is that there are multiple unique levels of exploration within each of us. Each layer can reveal a different angle or new areas of focus for growth evolving us to become prismatic.Our potential is driven from the main spirit channel, the heart \u2013 the keeper of our spark. Our breathing, the spiritus from which the word spirit evolved, is feeding the spark.Self-Awareness happens when we identify and tap into the roots of our beliefs with evaluation and reflection.Rootism is the belief that the truth is all around us always yet often hidden like a gem in the rough waiting for us to discover it with great enthusiasm.",

Do you want to reduce the amount of recycling you will have to pack out? Start by separating your your recyclables from any landfill trash. Then separate all your aluminum cans and bring them to Black Rock City Recycle Camp. We are located in Center Camp at 6:00, directly behind the Cafe. The camp is \"Open\" and ready to accept your cans Monday through Sunday, 9am to 5pm. Bring your clean, separated aluminum cans only. We definitely don't want your trash. We also do not accept any other recyclables, you can take them to one of the 24 hour recycling stations on your way back to Reno, check out your Survival Guide for more information. We provide a sorting area to check your cans for anything that isn't aluminum. Then you can ride the bike powered can crusher and crush your cans. After your cans get crushed, you will put your crushed cans into the large containers at the camp. All proceeds from the aluminum are donated to the Gerlach K-12 School in Gerlach, NV.

During the heat of the day, in triple digit temperatures, one must eat a helping of five-alarm chili, cooked with the dreaded Guatemalan insanity pepper (grown only by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum). Then, to wash it down, a shot of hot pepper vodka, also infused with the same insanely hot pepper. Now, when you want nothing more than an ice-cold beverage to quench the fire burning in your mouth, you instead must chug a cheap, warm beer that's been sitting out in the sun since daybreak. Why, might you ask, would anyone want to do this? Hell if we know! It's a terrible idea! It's a horrible thing to conceive, much less do on purpose! Yet, as demonstrated by the droves of people who participated AND completed the challenge in past years, we apparently underestimated human nature. Not only did crowds show up for the challenge, but they returned over the course of the week to to share the pain with their friends. And by share, we mean point and laugh while grown men cried and stumbled down the street in a daze. We even had a university anthropologist come hangout, just to observe this odd aspect of human behavior.  We're bringing it back spicier than ever for 2013!",

We've got 10,000 watts of juicy sound, some of the best real estate in Black Rock City, and a nighttime crowd just waiting to be whipped into a frenzy. All you have to do is wow our panel of judges and you too could be headlining Burning Man! For this contest we hearken back to that seminal masterpiece of talent programs: The Gong Show. Perhaps you remember the cringe-worthy showcase of questionable performances that critics could halt by striking a loud gong. This event is eerily similar, only ours has balls. Ovaries too. Giant, dusty gonads. Can you hang? Instead of a gong, DJs will wear a shock collar and get buzzed off stage by volts of harsh rejection if they fail to impress. Instead of regaling us with tap dancing, DJs break out their most mind blowing tracks and slickest tricks. Instead of a paltry sum to commemorate victory, winners will be invited back during peak hours to pound the dance floor into submission. This is open decks for the fearless. Bring it.",

We will have a variety of spanking stations and implements to use if bare handed is not your style. Once you have had your fill of spankings you may return to the street or you can come on back to the legendary Xanadome and chill out and relax. Have a drink if you'd like and a freshly baked cookie to reward yourself for a good spanking.  For the curious here is a quick FAQ on spanking.       1) How hard do I have to get spanked.  ANSWER: how hard do you want to be spanked?       2) How many swats do I need to receive to get a cookie?  ANSWER: At least one.    3) I am diabetic/not hungry/gluten intolerant/etc. and do not want a cookie, just a spanking is that okay?     ANSWER: Absolutely, you do not have to receive a cookie to get a spanking, but you must get a spanking to get a cookie.           4) Can I spank you?    ANSWER:  Ask us, we may or may not let you. Cuteness and snuggly bribery or swag works well.        5) I want my partner/friend to spank me instead of you, is that okay.     ANSWER: Of course. Please remember we want to keep you in your comfort zone.     6) Does it have to be bare bottom spanking or is that optional?    ANSWER:  That is completely up to your comfort zone. We will accommodate your limits.",

All couples welcome. \r\nAll couples are invited to this playful exploration of intimate partnership and love as a spiritual practice and path to realization.   Harness the wisdom of the body and the physical sensations of love to deepen trust, strengthen communications, and create a powerful shared vision for your love relationship.   Discover ancient Yogic, Tantric, and Taoist exercises that will allow you to gain deep insight into your relationship and see your partner in a whole new light, whether you just met on the playa or renewing your vows on your 40th anniversary. You will experience your partner\u2019s love and trust in a new and profound way. Learn how to use these powerful skills and movements to create a new and exciting level of intimacy that deepens the physical, spiritual, and emotional aspects of your sacred connection.  We will explore couple-hood as a yogic path to realization, letting go of the mind and surrendering to the heart through your lover. It is a practice of using your two-ness to realize oneness.  Yoga and Qigong are like brother and sister. Both are esoteric, alchemical practices that were created for self-realization, with exercise being a secondary benefit. Qigong is much gentler than most forms of yoga, and a wonderful compliment to a vigorous yoga practice. Both practices have a common source, Neolithic shamanic practices, and both are ancient books of wisdom written in the language of the body. We'll physically explore the connection between these 2 books of wisdom within the context of your love relationship. We are channeling the sexual and creative energies of the body through visualization, movement, ritual, and breath, not sexual activity. Tantric Qigong is an intimate practice of being gentle with oneself and weaving one's own sexual energy, becoming truly receptive.",

On a deeper level, it will draw on the very values of Burning Man, whose Ten Principles (radical inclusion, gifting, de-commodification, radical, self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, leaving no trace, participation, and immediacy) will provide touchstones for the speakers in their talks.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is in the spirit of the 10 Principles, TEDxBlackRockCity aims to be more than merely a staged performance. For it is intended, above all, to foster creativity among all of its remarkable participants \u2014 both on stage and off \u2014 drawing on the uniquely dynamic community of Burning Man to concoct an exemplar of that fertile soup churning with creative sparks.\r\n\r\nPlease join us for an exciting day at Play)A(Skool and the new Aspire \"Learning Center\" --- a collaborative interactivity zone created by Play)A(Skool, IDEATE and La Calaca.",

The Orgasmatron had been a fixture at Burning Man for many years, giving thousands of women exceptional physical pleasure in an environment that was very safe, comfortable and private. Three years ago we took everything we had learned and completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and we gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. This year we\u2019ve taken it that much further with a singular goal of maximizing our guests\u2019 overall pleasure, along with the comfort and sensuality of the environment. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience in an environment that is safe, comfortable and private, and which leaves you feeling completely respected and in control. Come solo, or better yet, bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. You can wear as much or as little as you would like while riding this marvelous machine, and you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, the Orgasamator Experience at our I-Scream Parlour is something you won't want to miss. Visit us at the Camp for Sensual Pleasures, in Spanky\u2019s Village, and also ask about The Pope\u2019s Massage & Hair washing.",

There are things which can be erotic, silly, or basic than the touch that leads to tickling. Tickling is a great way to explore a new avenue of fun and intimacy with your partner. It can be light, it can be soft, or it can be heavy and sadistic. \r\n\r\nWe will cover many aspects of tickling from playing with others, simple bondage techniques, wrestling, common toys you can use to make your partner cry out in fits of laughter, to discussions of how it can spice up your sex life.  We will cover some aspects of BDSM for the full spectrum of tickling fun.  In addition we will cover the proper etiquette for playing with someone new to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n There will also have a tickle challenge for the most ticklish man and woman attending the event. Those two will be tickled by our event  coordinators, the partner, and whomever else the person is comfortable with. The person who lasts the longest of tickle torment will win a cool prize and be crowned tickle king or queen of Black Rock City.\r\n\r\nYou must be 18 years of age or older to attend this event. This event is best suited for those with a partner. If you do not have a partner that does not mean you cannot attend. We cannot guarantee you will have a partner to play with, but we will try and match you up with someone or one of our instructors.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo be respectful of others and their boundaries. Just remember we are all here for fun, and we have at least two things in common. We are interested/curious about tickling and we are all burners.",

Twelve participants were interviewed and a thematic content analysis was conducted on the data, revealing the following overarching themes: Interpersonal relationships with the numinous, spiritual beings, and human beings are fostered; occurrence of transformative intrapersonal experiences; electronic dance music and its effects on the mind and body serve as a catalyst for experiences of transpersonal phenomena; experiences of a spiritual and mystical nature transpire; emphasis placed on the significance of set and setting. Findings suggest that having experiences of transpersonal phenomena at EDM events enhances health and wellbeing in day-to-day life.",

For our third incarnation the TBE~WaVe~ installation, our body~sonic dance platforms that afford participants a uniquely interactive experience to engage kinesthetically with the music, we are upping the visual ante with the addition of a 30ft. dome to our public frontage. This structure, which will be combined with our wave sculpture, will be curated by the visualist CINEMOEBA, who, as per his 2012 work, will once again be providing a wonderland of analog feedback & other projected delights. This in combination with our live fusion and  Dubstep centric line-up featuring some of the finest bass culture talent available on playa, denizens of Black Rock City can expect a fourth dimensional EXPERIENCE like no other. Come wobble the TBE~WaVe~ and challenge your perceptions of bass culture music from every learning and thinking modality. Discover the optimal conditions for proper bass culture appreciation, the facilitation of which is our primary mission. We are devoted to ensuring the Tsunami Bass well~spring of proper bass culture on playa is properly nurtured and celebrated at Burning Man. As the TBE Multiversity of Bass Culture Appreciation founders will preach, proper edutainment is our main goal.  We invite you to open your heart/mind and try a new \"substance over style\" attuned environment, carefully curated by bass culture artists (Established by the Tsunami Bass Experience's Morphous & ShiZaru) for artists & aficionados. This is not a \"nightclub on playa\" but rather a welcome respite for those seeking low-end frequency with the utmost decency... join us for a more intimate and holistically immersive esthetic environment in which you will experience a full range of frequencies, with the decibels enlightenly engineered properly. Line-up will be posted to the internets so find us!! ~Cheers!~}*{~ (BYOB, NO MOOP)",

Most forms of energy healing, such as Reiki, utilize the energy of manifested life. However, Vortex makes use of divine light and energy, which is more powerful, and can work more deeply, than the energy of manifested life alone. Vortex utilizes 49 different kinds of divine light that serve various functions, including energizing, clearing, purifying, releasing, etc. Finally, all of these forms of divine light are guided by divine consciousness, which brings the deepest power of transformation, i.e. healing separation consciousness. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will feature two Omega-level practitioners of VortexHealing\u00ae Divine Energy Healing who will facilitate a small group healing on a topic to be determined at the time of the workshop. Space will be limited to about 15 people.",

With a little instruction, the experience of the 5Rhythms opens us deeply and helps us move beyond self-consciousness to an authentic connection to our body and life force. Using the discipline of each rhythm and the breath as a catalyst for movement, you will be invited to embody, follow, express, and release your own energy.

That doesn\u2019t just apply to those of us in camp, there\u2019s thousands of people out on the playa that will be getting the mouse-hand shakes by the weekend. Since popping up the laptop and logging on isn\u2019t an option, we\u2019ll just have ourselves an addiction party instead.\r\n\r\nOpen to all everyone, gamer or not, we\u2019ll have a little gathering Saturday afternoon. Anyone who has completed our daily quests, or just wants to hang out and get their fix is welcome. Our resident mad alchemist has come up with some special brews, and servings of delicious chocolate cake are available to all. If any of our \"Dragonbreath\" chili remains, it\u2019s a great time to polish that off. Hang out, drink some \"kungaloosh\", take down a \"sulfuron slammer\", and swap war stories of \"How I wiped the 40 man raid\".",
