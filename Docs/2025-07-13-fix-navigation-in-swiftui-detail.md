# 2025-07-13: Fix Navigation in SwiftUI DetailView

## Problem Statement

Navigation from SwiftUI DetailView was failing with the error:
```
üß≠ Attempting navigation to object: Cosmic Giggle
‚ùå Navigation FAILED: Navigator is nil
   Presenter: DetailHostingController
```

The issue occurred because DetailHostingController was embedded as a child in UIPageViewController, making `self.navigationController` nil during `viewDidLoad`.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **UIPageViewController Context**: DetailHostingController is created and embedded in UIPageViewController in PageViewManager.swift:31
2. **Navigation Timing**: In `viewDidLoad`, the DetailHostingController doesn't have access to navigationController because it's not directly pushed onto the nav stack
3. **Parent Hierarchy**: The UIPageViewController itself is what gets pushed, so navigation controller is available through the parent hierarchy

## Solution Overview

Implemented a safe navigation controller traversal pattern following the existing iBurn codebase patterns (based on ListCoordinator.swift).

### Key Changes

1. **Added UIViewController Extension** for safe navigation controller access:
   ```swift
   extension UIViewController {
       var safeNavigationController: UINavigationController? {
           // Direct access first
           if let nav = navigationController { return nav }
           
           // Check presenting view controller (for modals)  
           if let nav = presentingViewController?.navigationController { return nav }
           
           // Traverse parent hierarchy (for UIPageViewController children)
           var current = parent
           while let parent = current {
               if let nav = parent.navigationController { return nav }
               current = parent.parent
           }
           
           return nil
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Moved Navigator Setup** from `viewDidLoad` to `viewDidAppear`:
   - `viewDidLoad`: UI setup only
   - `viewDidAppear`: Navigator setup when parent hierarchy is fully established

3. **Enhanced Logging** for debugging navigation context

### Files Modified

- **DetailHostingController.swift**: Added safe navigation extension, moved navigator setup to viewDidAppear

## Technical Details

### Navigation Context Flow

1. DetailHostingController created in factory
2. DetailHostingController embedded in UIPageViewController 
3. UIPageViewController pushed onto navigation stack
4. In DetailHostingController.viewDidAppear, safeNavigationController traverses parent hierarchy to find nav controller
5. Coordinator gets proper navigator for push operations

### Lifecycle Timing

- **viewDidLoad**: Basic UI setup, navigationController often nil for child VCs
- **viewDidAppear**: Parent hierarchy established, safe time for navigation-dependent setup

## Expected Outcomes

- "Show on Map" navigation should work from DetailView
- Camp host tapping should push camp detail view
- Navigation follows same pattern as existing BRCDetailViewController
- Compatible with both UIPageViewController and direct navigation contexts

## Additional Fix: "Show X events for [Camp Name]" Navigation

### Problem
The "Show 10 events for Sockdrawer" functionality was implemented but not working because `DetailActionCoordinator.showEventsList` case only printed a message instead of navigating.

### Solution
Implemented proper navigation to `HostedEventsViewController` following the old `BRCDetailViewController` pattern:

```swift
case .showEventsList(let events, let hostName):
    // Get host object from first event using database transaction
    BRCDatabaseManager.shared.uiConnection.read { transaction in
        relatedObject = firstEvent.host(with: transaction)
    }
    
    // Create and push HostedEventsViewController
    let eventsVC = HostedEventsViewController(
        style: .grouped,
        extensionName: BRCDatabaseManager.shared.relationships,
        relatedObject: host
    )
    navigator.pushViewController(eventsVC, animated: true)
```

### Key Implementation Details
- Uses `firstEvent.host(with: transaction)` to get camp/art object from events
- Initializes `HostedEventsViewController` with proper parameters (style: `.grouped`, extensionName: `BRCDatabaseManager.shared.relationships`)
- Pushes onto navigation stack (not modal) matching old implementation

## Test Plan

1. Enable SwiftUI DetailView feature flag
2. Navigate to an event with camp host
3. Tap camp host relationship 
4. Verify camp detail pushes successfully
5. **NEW**: Navigate to camp detail and tap "Show X events for [Camp Name]"
6. **NEW**: Verify HostedEventsViewController pushes with filtered events list
7. Test other navigation actions (Show on Map, etc.)

## Cross-References

- Related to SwiftUI DetailView rewrite project
- Follows patterns from ListCoordinator.swift:37-38
- Maintains compatibility with PageViewManager UIPageViewController setup
- **NEW**: Uses HostedEventsViewController pattern from BRCDetailViewController.m:389
