# 2025-08-03 PlayaDB Event Occurrence Redesign

## High Level Plan

Today's session focused on redesigning the event storage architecture in PlayaDB to eliminate the problematic "midnight splitting" behavior from the legacy YapDatabase implementation. The main goals were:

1. **Eliminate Event Splitting** - Remove the hacky practice of splitting events that span midnight into multiple database rows
2. **Maintain Backward Compatibility** - Ensure existing code expecting individual event objects with start/end dates continues to work
3. **Improve Data Model** - Create a cleaner separation between event data and occurrence data
4. **Enhanced Querying** - Implement proper date range queries that handle cross-midnight events correctly

## Legacy Problem Analysis

### Current YapDatabase/BRCEventObject Behavior
The existing system had two problematic splitting behaviors:

1. **Multiple Occurrences**: Each occurrence from `occurrence_set` becomes a separate `BRCEventObject`
2. **Cross-Midnight Events**: Events spanning multiple days (e.g., 10pm-2am) are split at midnight:
   - First event: 10pm-11:59:59pm (Day 1)  
   - Second event: 12:00am-2am (Day 2)

This was implemented in `BRCRecurringEventObject.m`:
```objc
// Split events across days at midnight
if (daysBetweenDates > 0) {
    NSLog(@"Duped dates for %@: %@", self.title, self.uniqueID);
    NSDate *newStartDate = eventTime.startDate;
    NSDate *newEndDate = [eventTime.startDate endOfDay];
    while ([NSDate brc_daysBetweenDate:newStartDate andDate:eventTime.endDate] >= 0) {
        // Create separate BRCEventObject for each day segment
        // event.uniqueID = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@-%d", self.uniqueID, eventCount];
    }
}
```

### Problems with This Approach
- **Data Duplication**: Same event data stored multiple times
- **Complex Queries**: Difficult to get all occurrences of a single event
- **Inconsistent State**: Updates require modifying multiple rows
- **Poor Performance**: More rows to manage and sync

## New PlayaDB Architecture

### Core Data Structure
```swift
// EventObject: One row per unique event (no timing data)
struct EventObject {
    let uid: String              // Original API event ID
    let name: String
    let description: String?
    let eventType: String
    // ... other event fields
    // NO startDate/endDate - those belong to occurrences
}

// EventOccurrence: Multiple rows per event (timing data only)
struct EventOccurrence {
    let id: Int64?
    let eventId: String          // References EventObject.uid
    let startTime: Date          // Original times, no midnight splitting
    let endTime: Date
}
```

### EventObjectOccurrence Composite Object
Created a composite object that combines an event with a specific occurrence for backward compatibility:

```swift
public struct EventObjectOccurrence: DataObject {
    let event: EventObject
    let occurrence: EventOccurrence
    
    // Synthesized unique ID for this specific occurrence
    var uid: String { "\(event.uid)_\(occurrence.id ?? 0)" }
    
    // Direct properties from occurrence
    var startDate: Date { occurrence.startTime }
    var endDate: Date { occurrence.endTime }
    
    // Delegated properties from event
    var name: String { event.name }
    var description: String? { event.description }
    // ... all other event properties
}
```

### GRDB Relationships
Implemented proper foreign key relationships:
```swift
// EventObject relationships
public extension EventObject {
    static let occurrences = hasMany(EventOccurrence.self, using: ForeignKey(["event_id"]))
    var occurrences: QueryInterfaceRequest<EventOccurrence> {
        request(for: EventObject.occurrences)
    }
}

// EventOccurrence relationships  
public extension EventOccurrence {
    static let event = belongsTo(EventObject.self, using: ForeignKey(["event_id"]))
    var event: QueryInterfaceRequest<EventObject> {
        request(for: EventOccurrence.event)
    }
}
```

## Enhanced Query Methods

### Updated PlayaDB Protocol
```swift
public protocol PlayaDB {
    // Returns composite objects for backward compatibility
    func fetchEvents() async throws -> [EventObjectOccurrence]
    
    // New date-based queries (no midnight splitting needed)
    func fetchEvents(on date: Date) async throws -> [EventObjectOccurrence]
    func fetchEvents(from startDate: Date, to endDate: Date) async throws -> [EventObjectOccurrence]
    func fetchCurrentEvents(_ now: Date) async throws -> [EventObjectOccurrence]
    func fetchUpcomingEvents(within hours: Int, from now: Date) async throws -> [EventObjectOccurrence]
}
```

### Smart Date Range Querying
For events spanning midnight, proper overlap detection:
```swift
func fetchEvents(on date: Date) async throws -> [EventObjectOccurrence] {
    let dayStart = calendar.startOfDay(for: date)
    let dayEnd = calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: 1, to: dayStart)!
    
    // Find occurrences that overlap with this day
    // Event overlaps if: starts before day ends AND ends after day starts
    let occurrences = try EventOccurrence
        .filter(Column("start_time") < dayEnd && Column("end_time") > dayStart)
        .including(required: EventOccurrence.event)
        .fetchAll(db)
    
    // Convert to EventObjectOccurrence instances
    return try occurrences.map { occurrence in
        let event = try occurrence.event.fetchOne(db)!
        return EventObjectOccurrence(event: event, occurrence: occurrence)
    }
}
```

## Import Logic Improvements

### Clean Import (No Splitting)
The PlayaDB import logic correctly imports from `occurrence_set` without any midnight splitting:

```swift
// Insert event occurrences (no splitting!)
for apiOccurrence in apiEvent.occurrenceSet {
    var eventOccurrence = EventOccurrence(
        id: nil,
        eventId: apiEvent.uid.value,
        startTime: apiOccurrence.startTime,    // Original start time
        endTime: apiOccurrence.endTime         // Original end time
    )
    try eventOccurrence.insert(db)
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

### EventObjectOccurrence Interface
The composite object provides full compatibility with existing `BRCEventObject` expectations:

```swift
// Timing methods for compatibility
func isHappeningRightNow(_ currentDate: Date = Date()) -> Bool
func isEndingSoon(_ currentDate: Date = Date()) -> Bool
func isStartingSoon(_ currentDate: Date = Date()) -> Bool
func shouldShowOnMap(_ now: Date = Date()) -> Bool

// Formatted strings
var startAndEndString: String    // "10:00AM - 4:00PM"
var startWeekdayString: String   // "Monday"
var durationString: String       // "2h 30m"

// All original event properties available
var eventTypeLabel: String
var hostedByCamp: String?
var location: CLLocation?
// ... etc
```

## Testing and Validation

### Comprehensive Test Suite
Created `EventObjectOccurrenceTests` with full coverage:
- Composite object creation and property delegation
- Timing methods (current, future, ending soon)
- Location handling with GPS coordinates
- Compatibility methods for legacy code
- Duration calculations and formatting

All tests pass, confirming the implementation works correctly.

## Benefits of New Architecture

### Technical Improvements
