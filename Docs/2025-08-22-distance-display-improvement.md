# Distance Display Improvement

**Date**: 2025-08-22
**Feature**: Updated distance formatting in detail screen

## High-Level Plan

### Problem Statement
The detail screen was displaying all distances in feet regardless of the value, which was not user-friendly for longer distances.

### Solution Overview
Updated the distance display logic to intelligently choose between feet and miles:
- Distances under 1000 feet: Display in feet (e.g., "500 ft")
- Distances 1000 feet and over: Display in miles (e.g., "1.2 mi")

## Technical Details

### File Modified
- `/Users/chrisbal/Documents/Code/iBurn-iOS/iBurn/Detail/Views/DetailView.swift`

### Changes Made
Updated the `DetailDistanceCell` struct's `formattedDistance` computed property (lines 413-429):

```swift
private var formattedDistance: String {
    let meters = Measurement(value: distance, unit: UnitLength.meters)
    let feet = meters.converted(to: .feet)
    let miles = meters.converted(to: .miles)
    
    let formatter = MeasurementFormatter()
    formatter.unitStyle = .short
    formatter.unitOptions = .providedUnit
    
    if feet.value < 1000 {
        formatter.numberFormatter.maximumFractionDigits = 0
        return formatter.string(from: feet)
    } else {
        formatter.numberFormatter.maximumFractionDigits = 1
        return formatter.string(from: miles)
    }
}
```

### Key Implementation Details
- Converts the source meters measurement to both feet and miles upfront
- Uses conditional logic to determine which unit to display
- Uses MeasurementFormatter consistently for both units
- Sets appropriate decimal places: 0 for feet, 1 for miles
- Maintains localization support through MeasurementFormatter

## Context Preservation

### User Request
"i want the distance on the detail screen to be feet under 1000 ft, then just show miles after that."

### Implementation Approach
The user clarified that both units should use MeasurementFormatter for consistency. Rather than converting feet to miles when needed, we convert the source meters to both units and then select which to display.

## Expected Outcomes
- Distances under 1000 feet display as whole numbers in feet (e.g., "750 ft")
- Distances 1000 feet and over display in miles with one decimal place (e.g., "1.2 mi")
- Consistent formatting and localization through MeasurementFormatter
- Improved user experience with more appropriate units for different distance ranges
