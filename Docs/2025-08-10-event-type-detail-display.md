# 2025-08-10 Event Type Detail Display

## High-Level Plan

**Problem**: Event detail screen didn't show the event type, making it unclear what category of event users were viewing.

**Solution**: Added event type display with emoji and descriptive text to the event detail screen, positioned prominently after the title.

## Technical Details

### Changes Made

**File**: `iBurn/Detail/ViewModels/DetailViewModel.swift`

**Location**: Line 388-390 in `generateEventCells()` method

**Implementation**:
```swift
// Event type with emoji
let eventTypeString = "\(event.eventType.emoji) \(event.eventType.displayString)"
cells.append(.text(eventTypeString, style: .subtitle))
```

### Display Format

The event type now appears as:
- Format: `[emoji] [display string]`
- Examples:
  - "🎉 Gathering/Party"
  - "🧑‍🏫 Class/Workshop" 
  - "💃 Performance"
  - "🔥 Fire/Spectacle"

### Cell Order

The event type appears in this order within event details:
1. Image (if available)
2. Title
3. Description
4. **Event Type (NEW)**
5. Host relationship (camp/art)
6. Next event from host
7. Schedule
8. Location
9. Host description

## Context Preservation

### Event Type System
- Event types are defined in `BRCEventObject.h` as an enum `BRCEventType`
- Display strings and emojis are mapped in `BRCEventObject.swift` extensions
- Each type has:
  - Emoji representation (e.g., 🎉 for Party)
  - Display string (e.g., "Gathering/Party")
  - Visibility flag (some types are hidden)

### Integration Points
- Uses existing `.text` cell type with `.subtitle` style
- Leverages BRCEventType extensions for display formatting
- No new UI components required
- Works with existing theme color system

## Expected Outcomes

Users viewing event details will now see:
- Clear indication of event type at the top of details
- Visual emoji representation for quick recognition
- Descriptive text for accessibility and clarity
- Consistent theming with rest of detail view

## Testing Verification

- Build completed successfully
- Event type displays correctly with emoji and text
- Cell positioning is logical and prominent
- No UI layout issues introduced
