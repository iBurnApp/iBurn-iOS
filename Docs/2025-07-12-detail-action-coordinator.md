# Detail Action Coordinator Implementation

## Date: 2025-01-12

## High-Level Plan

### Problem Statement
The project had three separate implementations of `handleDetailAction` logic in PageViewManager, MainMapViewController, and MapViewAdapter. This code duplication made maintenance difficult and violated DRY principles.

### Solution Overview
Extracted the duplicated logic into a protocol-based `DetailActionCoordinator` architecture with:
- Protocol abstraction for testability
- Factory pattern to hide implementation details
- Dependency injection for UIKit dependencies
- Clean architecture separation (ViewModel remains UIKit-free)

### Key Changes
1. Created protocol-based coordinator architecture
2. Removed duplicate implementations from three locations
3. Updated all integration points to use the coordinator
4. Added comprehensive unit tests with mock dependencies

## Technical Details

### Files Created

#### `/Users/chrisbal/Documents/Code/iBurn-iOS/iBurn/Detail/Services/DetailActionCoordinatorProtocols.swift`
Defines minimal UIKit protocol abstractions for testability:
```swift
protocol Presentable: AnyObject {
    func present(_ viewControllerToPresent: UIViewController, animated: Bool, completion: (() -> Void)?)
}

protocol Navigable: AnyObject {
    func pushViewController(_ viewController: UIViewController, animated: Bool)
}

extension UIViewController: Presentable {}
extension UINavigationController: Navigable {}
```

#### `/Users/chrisbal/Documents/Code/iBurn-iOS/iBurn/Detail/Services/DetailActionCoordinator.swift`
Main coordinator implementation with:
- `DetailActionCoordinator` protocol
- `DetailActionCoordinatorDependencies` struct for dependency injection
- `DetailActionCoordinatorFactory` for creating instances
- Private `DetailActionCoordinatorImpl` class with all action handling logic

Key features:
- Handles all DetailAction cases (email, URL, event editor, image viewer, etc.)
- Uses weak references to UIKit components to avoid retain cycles
- Factory pattern hides implementation details
- Fully testable through protocol abstractions

#### `/Users/chrisbal/Documents/Code/iBurn-iOS/iBurnTests/DetailActionCoordinatorTests.swift`
Comprehensive unit tests with mock implementations:
- `MockPresentable` and `MockNavigable` for testing
- Tests for all action types
- Verifies proper view controller creation and presentation

### Files Modified

#### `/Users/chrisbal/Documents/Code/iBurn-iOS/iBurn/Detail/ViewModels/DetailViewModel.swift`
- Changed from `actionsHandler: (DetailAction) -> Void` to `coordinator: DetailActionCoordinator`
- Added `showEventEditor()` method for toolbar button
- Updated all action handling to use `coordinator.handle(action)`

#### `/Users/chrisbal/Documents/Code/iBurn-iOS/iBurn/Detail/Controllers/DetailViewControllerFactory.swift`
- Updated both `create` methods to accept `coordinator` parameter instead of `actionsHandler`
- Pass coordinator to DetailHostingController

#### `/Users/chrisbal/Documents/Code/iBurn-iOS/iBurn/Detail/Controllers/DetailHostingController.swift`
- Added `coordinator` property
- Updated init to accept and store coordinator
- Pass coordinator to DetailViewModel

#### `/Users/chrisbal/Documents/Code/iBurn-iOS/iBurn/PageViewManager.swift`
- Removed duplicate `handleDetailAction` method
- Create coordinator using factory in `pageViewController` method
- Pass coordinator when creating detail views

#### `/Users/chrisbal/Documents/Code/iBurn-iOS/iBurn/MainMapViewController.swift`
- Removed duplicate `handleDetailAction` method
- Create coordinator in `didSelectObject` delegate method
- Use coordinator when creating detail view

#### `/Users/chrisbal/Documents/Code/iBurn-iOS/iBurn/MapViewAdapter.swift`
- Removed duplicate `handleDetailAction` method
- Create coordinator in map annotation tap handler
- Pass parent view controller to coordinator factory

#### `/Users/chrisbal/Documents/Code/iBurn-iOS/iBurn/Detail/Views/DetailView.swift`
- Fixed event button to call `viewModel.showEventEditor()`
- Changed from `if let eventObject =` to `if viewModel.dataObject is` to fix unused variable warning

#### `/Users/chrisbal/Documents/Code/iBurn-iOS/iBurn/Detail/Views/DetailView_Previews.swift`
- Added `MockDetailActionCoordinator` for SwiftUI previews
- Updated preview factory to use coordinator instead of actionsHandler

#### `/Users/chrisbal/Documents/Code/iBurn-iOS/CLAUDE.md`
- Added xcodebuild instructions for simulator builds
- Specified iOS 18.5, arch arm64, iPhone 16 Pro as default build target
- Added example commands for building and testing

## Context Preservation

### Design Decisions
1. **Protocol-based approach**: Enables easy testing and mocking
2. **Factory pattern**: Hides implementation details and provides clean API
3. **Dependency injection**: Makes coordinator fully testable
4. **Weak references**: Prevents retain cycles with UIKit components
5. **ViewModel stays pure**: No UIKit dependencies in ViewModel layer

### Memory Management
- DetailHostingController owns the coordinator (strong reference)
- Coordinator has weak references to presenter and navigator
- No retain cycles between ViewModel and coordinator

### Error Fixes
1. Fixed `uniqueId` error by using `yapKey` property instead
2. Fixed private coordinator access by adding `showEventEditor()` method to ViewModel
3. Fixed unused variable warning by using `is` instead of `if let`

## Cross-References
- Builds on previous DetailView SwiftUI migration work
- Related to `/Docs/2025-01-06-detail-view-implementation.md`
- Continues the SwiftUI integration effort

## Expected Outcomes
1. ✅ No more duplicate handleDetailAction implementations
2. ✅ All detail actions handled through centralized coordinator
3. ✅ Fully testable architecture with protocol abstractions
4. ✅ Clean separation of concerns (ViewModel has no UIKit dependencies)
5. ✅ Project builds successfully with no errors
6. ✅ All existing functionality preserved

## Updates - Enhanced Presentable Protocol

### Changes Made
1. **Enhanced Presentable Protocol**: Added `dismiss(animated:completion:)` method to Presentable protocol for better dismissal control
2. **Custom Image Viewer**: Created `ImageViewerViewController` class that uses the Presentable protocol's dismiss method instead of relying on UIViewController extensions
3. **Updated Tests**: Enhanced mock objects to test the new dismiss functionality
4. **Fixed Test Dependencies**: Updated all DetailViewModelTests to use the new coordinator parameter instead of the deprecated actionsHandler

### Technical Benefits
- Better separation of concerns with protocol-based dismissal
- More testable image viewer implementation
- Cleaner coordinator architecture that doesn't rely on UIViewController extensions
- All tests now passing with coordinator pattern

## Remaining Work
- Add proper map navigation implementation (currently just logs)
- Implement events list presentation
- Performance testing with large datasets
