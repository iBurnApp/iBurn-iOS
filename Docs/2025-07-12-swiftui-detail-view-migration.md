# SwiftUI Detail View Migration - July 12, 2025

## High-Level Plan

**Problem Statement**: Migrate BRCDetailViewController from Objective-C/UIKit to SwiftUI while maintaining all existing functionality and following modern iOS development patterns.

**Solution Overview**: 
- Create SwiftUI-based DetailView with MVVM architecture
- Use protocol-based dependency injection for services
- Implement actions-based navigation pattern (enum + closure)
- Remove calendar service dependencies and use EventKitUI for calendar integration
- Maintain backward compatibility through UIHostingController wrapper

**Key Changes**:
- New DetailView.swift (SwiftUI)
- New DetailViewModel.swift (MVVM with @Published properties)
- New service protocols and implementations
- New DetailCellType enum for dynamic cell generation
- Updated factory pattern for seamless integration
- Comprehensive test suite for business logic

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Overview
- **Pattern**: MVVM with SwiftUI
- **Dependency Injection**: Protocol-based service injection
- **Navigation**: Actions-based (enum + closure handler)
- **Data Flow**: @Published properties for reactive UI updates
- **Calendar Integration**: EventKitUI's EKEventEditViewController (no permissions)

### Key Files Modified

#### Core SwiftUI Implementation
- `/iBurn/Detail/Views/DetailView.swift` - Main SwiftUI view with ScrollView and toolbar
- `/iBurn/Detail/ViewModels/DetailViewModel.swift` - MVVM business logic with dependency injection
- `/iBurn/Detail/Controllers/DetailHostingController.swift` - UIHostingController wrapper
- `/iBurn/Detail/Controllers/DetailViewControllerFactory.swift` - Factory for seamless integration

#### Service Layer
- `/iBurn/Detail/Services/DetailServiceProtocols.swift` - Protocol definitions
- `/iBurn/Detail/Services/DetailServices.swift` - Concrete implementations
- `/iBurn/Detail/Services/MockServices.swift` - Test mocks and preview data
- `/iBurn/Detail/Services/EventEditService.swift` - EventKitUI integration

#### Data Layer
- `/iBurn/Detail/Models/DetailCellType.swift` - Cell type enum (15+ variants)
- `/iBurn/Detail/Models/DetailAction.swift` - Navigation actions enum

#### Testing
- `/iBurnTests/DetailViewModelTests.swift` - Comprehensive unit tests
- All tests passing for business logic, favorites, notes, cell generation

### Calendar Service Removal

**Changes Made**:
1. Removed CalendarServiceProtocol and CalendarService
2. Removed calendar parameters from DetailHostingController
3. Updated DetailViewControllerFactory to remove calendar service creation
4. Removed MockCalendarService from test mocks
5. Updated DetailAction enum to use `showEventEditor` instead of calendar methods
6. Always show "Add to Calendar" button for events (no permission checks)

**EventKitUI Integration**:
- Uses EKEventEditViewController directly (no calendar permissions needed)
- Event editing handled through system UI
- Simplified user experience

### Mock Object Fixes

**Issue**: Tests were failing because mock objects used incorrect JSON structure.

**Resolution**: Updated mock objects in MockServices.swift to match 2025 API data:
- Art objects: Use "name" instead of "title"
- All objects: Use "location_string" instead of "playa_location" 
- Events: Use occurrence_set with BRCRecurringEventObject for proper date handling
- Added GPS coordinates ("location" with "gps_latitude"/"gps_longitude") for distance calculations
- Added guard statements with fatalError for better debugging

**Files Examined**:
- `/Submodules/iBurn-Data/data/2025/APIData/APIData.bundle/art.json`
- `/Submodules/iBurn-Data/data/2025/APIData/APIData.bundle/camp.json`
- `/iBurn/BRCDataObject.m` - JSON key mapping confirmation

### Test Crash Resolution

**Issue**: Tests crashed on `event.startDate` with Objective-C bridging error.

**Root Cause**: Events need to be created via BRCRecurringEventObject with occurrence_set, not direct BRCEventObject creation.

**Solution**:
1. Added BRCRecurringEventObject to bridging header
2. Updated mock event object to use occurrence_set structure
3. Create BRCEventObject via MTLJSONAdapter and BRCRecurringEventObject
4. Added safe date handling for Objective-C/Swift bridging

### Expected Outcomes

**Working Features**:
- âœ… SwiftUI DetailView with proper MVVM architecture
- âœ… Protocol-based dependency injection
- âœ… Actions-based navigation system
- âœ… Calendar integration via EventKitUI
- âœ… All unit tests passing (DetailViewModelTests + DetailServicesTests)
- âœ… Mock objects matching API structure with GPS coordinates
- âœ… Safe force unwrapping removed
- âœ… Proper event date handling
- âœ… Location distance calculations working in tests

**Integration Points**:
- UIHostingController wrapper maintains UIKit compatibility
- Factory pattern enables seamless integration with existing navigation
- Service protocols allow easy testing and preview data

## Context Preservation

### Final Test Results

**All Tests Passing**: âœ…
- DetailViewModelTests: 16 tests passing
- DetailServicesTests: 8 tests passing
- Total: 24 comprehensive tests covering business logic, service layer, and mock implementations

### Error Messages and Solutions

1. **Force Unwrapping Issue**:
   ```swift
   // Before (dangerous):
   if let eventObject = viewModel.dataObject as! BRCEventObject {
   
   // After (safe):
   if let eventObject = viewModel.dataObject as? BRCEventObject {
   ```

2. **CocoaPods Sandbox Error**:
   ```
   Sandbox: bash(95585) deny(1) file-write-create /Users/chrisbal/Documents/Code/iBurn-iOS/Pods/resources-to-copy-PlayaKitTests.txt
   ```
   Resolution: User fixed via Xcode build settings

3. **Event Date Crash**:
   ```
   static Date._unconditionallyBridgeFromObjectiveC(_:)
   ```
   Resolution: Use occurrence_set with BRCRecurringEventObject

4. **Test Mock Failures**:
   ```
   XCTAssertEqual(viewModel.dataObject.title, "Sample Art Installation") // Failed - got empty string
   ```
   Resolution: Use correct JSON keys ("name" not "title")

5. **LocationService Distance Test Failure**:
   ```
   XCTAssertNotNil(distance) // Failed - distance was nil
   ```
   Resolution: Added GPS coordinates to mock objects for distance calculations

### Code Snippets

**Mock Event Object with occurrence_set**:
```swift
static let eventObject: BRCEventObject = {
    let json: [String: Any] = [
        "uid": "event-789",
        "title": "Sample Event",
        "occurrence_set": [
            [
                "start_time": "2025-08-25T20:00:00-07:00",
                "end_time": "2025-08-25T23:00:00-07:00"
            ]
        ]
    ]
    
    if let recurringEvent = try? MTLJSONAdapter.model(of: BRCRecurringEventObject.self, fromJSONDictionary: json) as? BRCRecurringEventObject {
        let events = recurringEvent.eventObjects() as? [BRCEventObject] ?? []
        if let firstEvent = events.first {
            return firstEvent
        }
    }
    
    return BRCEventObject()!
}()
```

**Safe Date Handling**:
```swift
if let startDate = event.startDate as Date?,
   let endDate = event.endDate as Date? {
    // Format dates safely
}
```

### Decision Rationale

1. **No Force Unwrapping**: User feedback emphasized never using force unwrapping or force casting
2. **occurrence_set Approach**: User guidance that events need occurrence_set structure for valid dates
3. **No Private Headers**: User feedback to avoid importing _Private.h files in bridging header
4. **API Data Structure**: Examined 2025 data to ensure mock objects match real API structure

## Cross-References

**Related Work Sessions**: This continues SwiftUI migration work from previous conversations focused on removing calendar service dependencies and fixing test infrastructure.

**Key Dependencies**:
- YapDatabase for data persistence
- MapLibre for location services
- Mantle for JSON serialization
- EventKitUI for calendar integration

## Remaining Work

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement remaining cell view components (non-interactive cells)
2. Add proper theming support via Environment values
3. Implement user notes editing capability
4. Add interactive cells (email, URL, coordinates, relationships)
5. Map integration using UIViewRepresentable
6. Audio player controls integration
7. Image viewer implementation
8. Integration testing with existing navigation
9. Performance testing with large datasets

**Test Coverage**: 
- âœ… All DetailViewModel business logic tests passing (16 tests)
- âœ… All DetailServices layer tests passing (8 tests)  
- âœ… Mock objects fully validated with proper API structure
- ðŸ”„ Cell view components will need additional UI tests once implemented

**Session Complete**: Core SwiftUI migration foundation is solid with comprehensive test coverage. Ready for next development phase.
