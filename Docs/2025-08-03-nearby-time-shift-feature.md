# Nearby Time Shift Feature Implementation

**Date:** August 3, 2025  
**Developer:** Claude Code  
**Status:** Complete  

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive time-shift feature for the Nearby screen that allows users to explore events, art, and camps as if they were at a different time and/or location. This enables users to plan ahead and see what will be available at future times during Burning Man.

## Problem Statement

Users needed the ability to:
1. View upcoming events and activities in the Nearby screen
2. Plan their schedule by seeing what will be happening at different times
3. Optionally change their location to explore different areas of Black Rock City
4. Have their time-shift preferences persist between app sessions

## Solution Overview

Created a time-shift system using modern SwiftUI/UIKit integration patterns with dependency injection and proper architectural separation.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Components

#### 1. Core Model
- **TimeShiftConfiguration.swift**: Data structure holding time/location shift state
  - `date: Date` - The shifted time
  - `location: CLLocation?` - Optional location override  
  - `isActive: Bool` - Whether time shifting is currently enabled

#### 2. ViewModel Layer
- **TimeShiftViewModel.swift**: ObservableObject managing state and business logic
  - Dependency injection friendly design
  - Separate callbacks for cancel/apply actions
  - Real-time change detection with `hasUnsavedChanges`
  - Computed properties for time offset display

#### 3. SwiftUI Interface
- **TimeShiftView.swift**: Main sheet interface with medium/large detents
  - Date/time picker wheel interface
  - Quick action buttons (Now, +1 Day, Sunset)
  - Real-time preview of selected time
- **TimeShiftMapView.swift**: Interactive map for location selection
  - MapLibre integration with custom annotations
  - Tap-to-select location functionality
  - Visual feedback with orange pin markers

#### 4. UIKit Integration
- **TimeShiftViewController.swift**: UIHostingController bridge
  - Proper sheet presentation configuration
  - Medium/large detent support with drag indicator
- **NearbyViewController.swift**: Enhanced with time-shift capability
  - Navigation bar button with time offset display
  - Visual indicators when time-shifted (orange styling)
  - Info label showing current shifted time
  - Integration with existing BRCDataSorter filtering

#### 5. Persistence Layer
- **UserSettings.swift**: Extended with time-shift configuration storage
  - Automatic save/restore of time-shift state
  - Proper cleanup when time-shift is disabled
  - Separate keys for date and location components

### UI/UX Design

#### Navigation Bar Integration
- Left navigation bar item shows current time state
- "Now" when not time-shifted
- "+1d", "-3h" etc. format for time shifts
- Orange styling when active to indicate shifted state

#### Sheet Presentation
- Medium detent by default (shows map + basic controls)
- Large detent for full interface access
- Drag indicator for discoverability
- Proper SwiftUI navigation with Cancel/Apply buttons

#### Visual Feedback
- Orange color theming throughout for time-shift indicators
- Info label in table header showing shifted date/time
- Map annotations with distinctive orange pins
- Real-time preview of selected time formatting

### Integration with Existing Systems

#### Event Filtering
- Modified `BRCDataSorter` calls to use shifted date as `options.now`
- Enabled `showExpiredEvents` and `showFutureEvents` when time-shifting
- Preserved existing filter logic (All/Events/Art/Camps)

#### Location Services  
- Override `getCurrentLocation()` to return shifted location when active
- Seamless integration with existing location-based queries
- Fallback to real location when not overridden

#### Data Persistence
- Automatic save/restore through UserSettings
- Survives app restarts and background/foreground cycles
- Clean removal of settings when disabled

## Bug Fixes Applied (August 3, 2025)

After initial implementation, several UI/UX issues were identified and resolved:

### Issue 1: Map Location Selection Not Visible
**Problem**: Selected location pins were not appearing on the TimeShiftMapView  
**Solution**: 
- Improved annotation view with larger, more visible orange pin (44x44 instead of 30x30)
- Added pulsing animation to draw attention
- Added shadow effects for better visibility
- Enhanced coordinates display in annotation subtitle
- Fixed map interaction to always allow tapping

### Issue 2: Navigation Bar Geocoder Not Showing Overridden Location
**Problem**: Navigation title continued showing real location instead of time-shifted location  
**Solution**:
- Modified `geocodeNavigationBar()` extension to use `getCurrentLocation()` from SortedViewController
- Added orange text color when location is overridden
- Created `isLocationOverridden()` method for clean status checking
- Ensured proper main thread dispatch for UI updates

### Issue 3: Table Header Time-Shift Info Not Displaying
**Problem**: Time-shift information label was not appearing in table header  
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `updateTimeShiftInfoLabel()` with better layout handling
- Added emoji indicators (‚è∞ for time, üìç for location)
- Improved text formatting with orange styling
- Fixed table header height calculation and view reassignment
- Added force layout updates to ensure visibility

### Issue 4: No Way to Reopen Time-Shift from Navigation Title
**Problem**: Users couldn't easily access time-shift interface after closing  
**Solution**:
- Added tap gesture recognizer to navigation title label
- Made `timeShiftButtonPressed()` internal instead of private
- Enhanced user discoverability of tap functionality

### Issue 5: No Location Address Display in Time-Shift Interface
**Problem**: Users couldn't see the address of their selected location  
**Solution**:
- Created `LocationAddressView` SwiftUI component
- Integrated PlayaGeocoder for real-time address lookup
- Added coordinate display in monospaced font
- Included loading states and error handling
- Added visual styling consistent with app theme

### Technical Improvements Made:
- Fixed SwiftUI color references (`.systemOrange` ‚Üí `.orange`)
- Corrected font family syntax (`.fontFamily()` ‚Üí `.font(.system(design:))`)
- Added proper import statements for PlayaGeocoder
- Enhanced accessibility and visual feedback throughout
- Improved error handling and edge cases

All fixes maintain the existing architecture patterns and design consistency while significantly improving the user experience.

## Warp Travel UI Enhancements (August 3, 2025)

After user feedback, implemented major improvements to the time-shift (now "Warp Travel") interface:

### Issues Addressed:

1. **Map Pin Persistence**
   - Fixed: Pin now properly persists when location is selected
   - Annotation visibility logic updated to always show when location is set

2. **Map Zoom Behavior** 
   - Implemented bounds fitting to show both user location and warped location
   - Smart padding and zoom levels for optimal visibility
   - Handles cases when user location isn't available yet

3. **Reset Logic**
   - Fixed: Resetting location no longer disables Apply button
   - Location reset is now treated as a valid change that can be applied
   - Clearer distinction between clearing location and disabling override

4. **Enhanced UI/UX**
   - Renamed to "Warp Travel" to emphasize bending time and space
   - Time display now shows: Real Time ‚Üí Warped Time with visual arrow
   - Added comprehensive location comparison showing both locations side-by-side
   - Added prominent "Reset to Reality" button when warped
   - Clear visual indicators for all states

### New Components:

#### LocationComparisonView
- Shows real location vs warped location
- Live geocoding for both addresses  
- Distance calculation between locations
- Visual hierarchy with icons and colors
- Loading states for address lookup

#### Enhanced Time Display
- "Time Warp" section with real ‚Üí warped format
- Clear visual flow showing the transformation
- Offset description maintained for context
- Improved typography and spacing

#### Smart Reset Options
- "Reset to Reality" - returns both time and location to current
- "Clear Location" - removes selected location but keeps override enabled
- "Now" button - resets just time
- All actions properly update hasUnsavedChanges

### Technical Improvements:
- Added `isAtCurrentReality` computed property
- Enhanced `hasUnsavedChanges` logic for all edge cases
- Fixed deprecation warning for map bounds setting
- Improved state management throughout
- Better separation of concerns

The Warp Travel feature now provides an intuitive, visually clear interface for exploring different times and locations within the Burning Man experience.

## Event Filtering Bug Fix (August 3, 2025)

### Issue
When time-shifting was active, the Nearby screen was showing ALL events instead of properly filtering them based on the shifted time. This made the feature unusable as it displayed every event regardless of when they occurred.

### Root Cause
The code was setting both `showExpiredEvents` and `showFutureEvents` to `true` when time-shifting, which completely disabled all time-based filtering in `BRCDataSorter`.

### Solution
Removed the special handling for time-shifted filtering. Since `BRCDataSorter` already uses `options.now` for all time comparisons, it automatically filters events correctly based on the provided date (whether real or shifted).

### Result
Events are now properly filtered when time-shifted:
- Shows only events that are "starting soon" (within 30 minutes) relative to the shifted time
- Shows events that are "happening right now" relative to the shifted time
- Properly hides expired events and far-future events relative to the shifted time

This fix ensures the time-shift feature works as intended, allowing users to see what events would be available at their chosen warped time.
