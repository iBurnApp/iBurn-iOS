# Filter and Map Icon Consistency Update

## Date: 2025-08-10

## High-Level Plan

Replace text labels "Filter" and "Map" with icons in navigation bar buttons to ensure consistency across all view controllers in the app.

## Problem Statement

Some view controllers were still using text labels ("Filter" and "Map") in their navigation bar buttons while others had already been updated to use icons. This created an inconsistent user experience.

## Solution Overview

Updated the remaining text-based navigation bar buttons to use SF Symbols icons:
- Filter button: `line.3.horizontal.decrease.circle` icon
- Map button: `map` icon

## Key Changes

### 1. EventListViewController.swift (line 117)
**Before:**
```swift
let filter = UIBarButtonItem(title: "Filter", style: .plain, target: self, action: #selector(filterButtonPressed(_:)))
```

**After:**
```swift
let filter = UIBarButtonItem(image: UIImage(systemName: "line.3.horizontal.decrease.circle"), style: .plain, target: self, action: #selector(filterButtonPressed(_:)))
```

### 2. MapButtonHelper.swift (line 18)
**Before:**
```swift
let map = UIBarButtonItem(title: "Map", style: .plain) { [weak self] (button) in
    self?.mapButtonPressed(button)
}
```

**After:**
```swift
let map = UIBarButtonItem(image: UIImage(systemName: "map"), style: .plain) { [weak self] (button) in
    self?.mapButtonPressed(button)
}
```

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `/Users/chrisbal/Documents/Code/iBurn-iOS/iBurn/EventListViewController.swift`
- `/Users/chrisbal/Documents/Code/iBurn-iOS/iBurn/MapButtonHelper.swift`

### View Controllers Affected
- **EventListViewController**: Now uses filter icon instead of text
- **ObjectListViewController**: Uses MapButtonHelper protocol, now shows map icon
- **NearbyViewController**: Uses MapButtonHelper protocol, now shows map icon
- **FavoritesViewController**: Already had icons for both (no changes needed)
- **ArtListViewController**: Already had filter icon (no changes needed)

### Icon Choices
- **Filter Icon**: `line.3.horizontal.decrease.circle` - A standard iOS filter icon showing horizontal lines with decreasing length
- **Map Icon**: `map` - A standard iOS map icon

## Context Preservation

### Initial Investigation
1. Found that EventListViewController was using text "Filter" for its filter button
2. Found that MapButtonHelper protocol was using text "Map" for map buttons
3. Discovered that FavoritesViewController and ArtListViewController had already been updated to use icons

### Build Verification
- Successfully built the project after changes using `xcodebuild`
- Confirmed no compilation errors introduced
- All view controllers now consistently use icons instead of text

## Expected Outcomes

After these changes:
1. All navigation bar buttons for Filter and Map functionality use consistent icons
2. Improved visual consistency across the app
3. Better accessibility as icons are language-independent
4. More modern appearance following iOS design guidelines

## Completion Status

âœ… All tasks completed successfully:
- Researched current implementation
- Replaced text with icons in EventListViewController
- Replaced text with icons in MapButtonHelper protocol
- Verified build succeeds with changes
